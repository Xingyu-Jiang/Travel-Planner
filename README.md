# Travel-Planner
Develop a working program that can help the user that wants to travel, calculating the shortest path possible and the cheapest path.

## Goal
The main goal of this project is to develop a traveling GUI application using undirected weighted graph data structure. The vertices are the cities, and the edges are a list containing the time and cost i.e. [5 Hours, $37]. The application will provide the user with two results: First result is to provide the cheapest way to travel from city A to city B, and the second result is to provide the shortest route to travel from city A to city B.
